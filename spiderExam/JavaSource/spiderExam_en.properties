page.index.content=<h2>Code Generation</h2>\
<p>In the 1990's it was rather usual to hear rumors about CASE tools, which, starting from diagrams, would generate for the programmer the source code of a whole system. There were promises that it would be the future of system development, many times making codification unnecessary. Also, there were predictions that it would replace the human being in many situations.</p>\
<p>As time went by, it became clear that many CASE tools that had proposed 'magic' or simply do all man's work had failed or hadn't reached the proposed result.</p>\
<p>This is natural, for a great deal of codes generated only by diagrams can have as a result a "dirty" twisted code with unnecessary instructions which turns maintenance or customization extremely complex for the programmer. Besides, many times, the final result is not the one expected by the analyst or the one promised by the CASE tool.</p>\
<p>So, in case you're thinking we are proposing this kind of magic or simply massive code generation with no criteria for the programmer, we are not. That's not our objective.</p>\
